# Language_Detection_Model_Using-PythonML
🚀 Project Overview: I developed a language detection model designed to identify 22 distinct languages using a dataset of 20,000 rows. The primary objective is to accurately predict the language of a given text by employing advanced machine learning techniques. This project integrates a variety of libraries for data manipulation, text processing, and model building. The model successfully achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 95.33% during training and testing, reflecting its efficiency and reliability. 🌍📊
